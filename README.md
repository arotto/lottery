You will need your own Census API key to query the US Census with the 'load_demographics.py' script. For more information, see: http://www.opengeocode.org/tutorials/USCensusAPI.php

Field codes for the American Community Survey (ACS5) queries used by load_demographics.py are located in data/acs5_codes.txt -- see details in Methods.
